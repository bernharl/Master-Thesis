First of all I would like to thank my girlfriend for keeping me company during these 
last semesters. Writing a thesis in lockdown during a pandemic is not the most optimal 
scenario, but having here by my side writing her own thesis in the same situation 
has helped immensely. 

I want to thank my main supervisor Simon Wolfgang Funke for our weekly discussions and his 
uplifting spirit. I also want to thank Matt Felix from Statkraft who has been 
heavily involved with this thesis.
