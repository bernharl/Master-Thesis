\section{Machine Learning}
We give a brief explanation of the basics in Machine Learning here for better context 
before elaborating on the LSTM model central to this thesis.
The term Machine Learning was coined in \citationneeded by .... 
Machine Learning is a type of frequentist approach to statistical analysis where 
one creates a statistical model, often with several million parameters and finds 
the value of each parameter that makes the model approximate the data in the most 
accurate manner. How to find these parameters and how they are used differ for each 
model type. 
\subsection{Linear regression}
In the simple case of the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model we have a model on the form 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\hat{y}} = \mathbf{\beta} \mathbf{X}
\label{OLS}
\end{equation}
This assumes that the outcome $\mathbf{\hat{y}}$ can we represented as a linear combination 
of some fitted parameters $\mathbf{\beta}$ and the input features $\mathbf{X}$.
The goal here is then to find the minimum of the mean squared error (MSE) of this.
The MSE is defined as 
\begin{equation}
MSE = |\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{\hat{y}}|^2
\label{MSE}
\end{equation}
Here $\mathbf{y}$ is the observed outcome, in many cases called the ground truth.
$\mathbf{\hat{y}}$ is the prediction made by (\ref{OLS}). The goal is to find the
$\mathbf{\beta}$ that minimizes (\ref{MSE}). For this there is an analytical solution 
as long as the matrix in (\ref{OLS}) is reversible. In other words: This can be solved
analytically as long as there are more data points than there are variables (features, inputs).
The solution to the equation can be written as 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\beta} = (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{y}
\label{OLS solution}
\end{equation}
\subsection{Bias-Variance trade-off}
\label{Bias-Variance trade-off}
When training any kind of machine learning model, one usually divides the data 
into at least two parts: The training dataset and the testing dataset. The training 
dataset is for training a given model, while the testing dataset is to be kept separate 
from the training process so as to not make the performance metrics of the model too optimistic. 
By "optimistic" what is meant is that the error, for scalar values (\ref{MSE}) is 
lower on the data the model is trained on than on data the model has not seen under 
training. The function that is minimized under machine learning is called a 
cost function and while (\ref{MSE}) is very commonly used for scalar outcomes 
there exist many other cost functions all with different characteristics. \citationneeded

To explain 
why this is important we need to have a quick look at what is known as the 
bias variance trade-off.
In the case of the OLS model the MSE can be rewritten into three parts:
\begin{equation}
    MSE = \text{Bias}^2 + \text{Variance} + \sigma^2
    \label{Bias Variance Decomp}
\end{equation}
For a full derivation of this, see \cite{vijayakumar2007bias}. When selecting and 
configuring machine learning models this trade-off is essential. The following is 
a qualitative explanation of what each term in (\ref{Bias Variance Decomp})
represents:
\begin{itemize}
\item Bias: The bias is the part of the error that comes from a model's lack of complexity.  If one were to try and represent a non-linear system on the form of (\ref{OLS}) for instance one would struggle to model the more complex interactions between input and outcome.
\item Variance: In many ways this error is the opposite of bias. It comes from a given model having too much complexity. This could come from the model having too many parameters to train compared to how much data is available for training. 
\item $\sigma^2$: This is known as the irreducible error. It is the inherent error in the data that is used for training. The model cannot reduce the error below this value as it is independent from the model. To reduce this error one would have to gather more accurate data using better instruments for instance. 
\end{itemize}
The aim of training a machine learning model is to find the best tradeoff between model
complexity and stability in search of the minimum of (\ref{Bias Variance Decomp}).
\subsection{Gradient Descent}
While the simple case of linear regression has an easily attainable analytical solution 
as seen in (\ref{OLS solution}), more advanced models may not. \citationneeded 
A generic computational optimization algorithm known as Gradient Descent can therefore 
be beneficial to employ in such a case \cite{elemstatlearn} \cite{handson}. The 
fundamental concept of Gradient Descent is to calculate the gradient $\Delta F(\mathbf{x})$ 
of the loss function $F(\mathbf{x})$. In the case of regression this function would 
be the MSE as described in (\ref{MSE}) while the variable $\mathbf{x}$ would be 
the regression coefficients $\mathbf{\beta}$. After calculating $\Delta F(\mathbf{x})$ 
one then does a gradient descent step, which is defined as
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{x}_{i+1} = \mathbf{x}_{i} - \lambda \Delta_x F(\mathbf{x_i}).
	\label{Gradient descent}
\end{equation}
Here the subscript $i$ denotes the epoch. An epoch is defined as the point when 
the optimization algorithm has seen all the data in your training set once. 
$\lambda$ is called the learning rate and is known as a hyperparameter. 
A hyperparameter is a model parameter that is not trained in the training process 
and has to be optimized in a different way. More on this in chapter \ref{Hyperparameters}
A problem with (\ref{Gradient descent}) is that one is never guaranteed to find the 
absolute minimum of $F(\mathbf{x})$, the algorithm often converges at local minima \cite{elemstatlearn}.
The solution to this is to introduce stochasticity to the optimization algorithm. 
Stochastic Gradient Descent is a modification of (\ref{Gradient descent}) which 
iterates over minibatches of your dataset instead of the entire dataset at once. 
This has two main benefits:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It adds stochasticity by shuffling the batches for each epoch.
\item It significantly reduces the amount of RAM needed to run the calculations on a computer.
\end{enumerate}
Introducing minibatches yields another hyperparameter in form of the batch size. 
This is the amount of datapoints to be used in each iterations. An iteration is 
defined as when the optimizer has seen all data points in a minibatch, and there are 
therefore several iterations in an epoch.
Adding more complexity to Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) we get to the optimizer 
known as Adaptive Moment EstimAtioN (Adam) \cite{adam}. The ADAM optimizer is 
an optimizer which uses minibatches and also what is known as a momentum based approach.
As a slight simplification from what's written in \cite{fysstkweek40} the ADAM 
algorithm in terms of equations looks like:
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{g}_i &= \Delta_x E(\bm{x}) \\
    \bm{m}_i &= \frac{\beta_1 \bm{m}_{i-1} + (1 - \beta_1)\bm{g}_i}{1 - \beta_1^i} \\
    \bm{s}_i &= \frac{\beta_2 \bm{s}_{i-1} + (1-\beta_2)\bm{g}^2_i}{1 - \beta_2^i} \\
    \bm{x}_{i+1} &= \bm{x}_i - \eta_i \frac{\bm{m}_i}{\sqrt{\bm{s}_i}+ \epsilon}
\end{align}
Following the same naming scheme as (\ref{Gradient descent}), $\bm{x}$ is the 
learning parameter of the model and the subscript $i$ denotes the epoch (except 
for $\beta_{1/2}^i$, where it means power). 
$\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are two constants usually set to $\beta_1 = 0.9$ and 
$\beta_2 = 0.999$. $\epsilon$ is a regularization constant to avoid numerical 
instability in the fraction and is usually $\epsilon=1E-8$\footnote{These values 
for $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$ and $\epsilon$ are mentioned in \cite{adam} and seem 
to be used in practice in most cases. They are also the default values of the 
ADAM implementation in the Machine Learning Framework Pytorch \cite{NEURIPS2019_9015}.}.
$\bm{m}$ and $\bm{s}$ are known as the first and second momentum of the gradient 
$\bm{g}$ respectively. The learning rate $\eta_i$\\ is here subscripted with the 
epoch $i$. This is to allow for non-constant learning rates which is often beneficial \citationneeded.
\footnote{Although perhaps less needed for the ADAM optimizer as one can tune the 
$\beta$-constants to achieve a similar effect.}
The benefits of the ADAM optimizer is that it has low memory requirement and it calculates 
individual learning rates for for different parameters of a learning algorithm. 
This makes the learning rate $\lambda$ a bit more ambiguous as it is weighed 
differently for each parameter.
\subsection{Neural Networks}
Previously we used Ordinary Least Squares to introduce simple concepts in Machine 
Learning. As the model we use to do our analysis in this thesis is a type of 
Recurrent Neural Network, we now give a short introduction to ordinary neural 
networks before working us up to describing more advanced models like Recurrent 
Neural Networks (RNNs).
A neural network is a non-linear machine learning model that can be used for both 
regression and classification. In this thesis we focus on the regression case and 
will therefore stick to describing that. The concept of the neural network was 
first described in \cite{rosenblatt1958perceptron}. 
\begin{figure}
    \caption{A perceptron model as described in \cite{rosenblatt1958perceptron}}
    \label{Neural network figure}
\end{figure}
Mathematically, a neural network can be written described on this form:
\begin{equation}
    y_i^l = f^l \left( \sum_{j=1}^{N_{l-1}}\omega_{ij}^l y^{l-1}_j+b^l_i  \right)
    \footnote{While the concept is cited to \cite{rosenblatt1958perceptron}, this 
    equation was taken from Morten Hjorth-Jensen's great lecture notes \cite{fysstkweek40}
    from the Universuty of Oslo course Fys-Stk4155 as this is the author's favorite 
    mathematical description of a neural network}
    \label{MLP equation}
\end{equation}
There are a lot of variables, subscripts and superscripts here, going through them 
systematically so as to not overwhelm the reader:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $l$ denotes what layer in the neural network we are in. Look at Figure 
    \ref{Neural network figure} to understand what is meant by a layer.
    \item $i$ denotes what "neuron" in layer $l$ we are looking at. 
    \item $y_i^l$ means the output of neuron $i$ in layer $l$. At the output layer $l=L$, it denotes the model output.
    \item $f^l$ is the activation function in layer $l$. An activation function is a function that is used to make the neural network non-linear. Some common activation functions are the Sigmoid function and $\tanh$. For the output layer $l=L$ the activation function is often different depending on whether we are doing classification or regression. For regression $f^L$ is often just $f^L(x)=x$.
    \item $\omega_{ij}^l$ is the weight corresponding to the output $y_j^{l-1}$ from neuron $j$ in layer $l-1$ when sent to neuron $i$ in layer $l$
    \item $b_i^l$ is known the bias term. It is a constant that is added to all inputs in neuron $i$ in layer $l$.
    \item The input to $f^l$ (the weighted sum plus the bias) can also be denoted as $z^l_j$
\end{itemize}
The parameters $b$ and $\omega$ are trained using an optimizer. In the case of this 
thesis that would be the ADAM optimizer. To get gradients to use in the optimizer 
an algorithm known as backpropagation is used. Backpropagation is an algorithm that 
takes the gradient at the output layer $L$, which usually is easily derivable and 
uses the chain rule to find the gradient of the loss function with respect to all 
the weights and biases in the network.
For a normal feed forward neural network, the backpropagation algorithm can be written 
as 
\begin{align}
    \delta^L_j &= \dv{f^L(z)}{z}\left(z^L_j\right) \pdv{C}{y^L_j} \label{output_backprop}\\
    \delta^l_j &= \sum_k \delta^{l+1}_k \omega^{l+1}_{kj} \dv{f^l(z)}{z}\left(z^l_j\right) \cite{fysstkweek40} \label{backprop}
\end{align}
The first equation (\ref{output_backprop}) is for the special case of the output 
layer, where $l=L$. This needs to be calculated first for us to be able to use 
(\ref{backprop}) to calculate $\delta^l_j$ for the neurons in the rest of the layer. 
The term $\delta^l_j$ is then used to get gradients for the weights $\omega^l_j$ 
and biases $b^l_j$ in this manner:
\begin{align}
    \pdv{C}{\omega^l_j} &= \delta^l_j y^l_j \label{dw}\\
    \pdv{C}{b^l_j} &= \delta^l_j \label{db}
\end{align}
Applying an optimizer step on all weights and biases using \ref{dw} and \ref{db}
will then ideally make the model reduce the cost function of the training data.
There is more to this than that though, hyperparameters, model complexity (often 
referring to the amount of parameters. In the case of a neural network that would 
be the amount of nodes and layers) dictate how well the model can fit the training 
data. As we discuss in chapter \ref{Bias-Variance trade-off} we do not always want 
the model to perfectly predict the training data as that can make the model perform 
worse on data is has not seen during training. There is also the problem of the 
optimization algorithm not necessarily hitting a global minimum then converging. 
The parameter-loss space is a complex high dimensional space often with infinitely 
many local minima that can lead the model to a worse fit than would be possible 
otherwise. \citationneeded
\subsection{Recurrent Neural Networks}
A normal feed forward neural network is only sufficient at learning the relationship 
between non-structured inputs and outputs. This means that it is not well suited 
for image analysis, where each pixel's position relative to other pixels is important. 
It also means that it is not sufficient for time series data where you ideally 
want a model than can sequentially run through the data and use information about 
the past to better predict the future.

A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a neural network that takes timed inputs 
sequentially, changing modifying the "state" of the network while using the same 
parameters for all future time-steps. In simple terms the algorithm goes like this:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The model takes an input $\bm{x_t}$
    \item Using trained parameters it updates a hidden state vector $\bm{h_t}$
    \item The models gives an output based on the parameters and the hidden state $\bm{y_t}$.
\end{enumerate}
For an ordinary RNN the state updates and outputs are defined as: 
\footnote{Note that this describes only a single RNN cell. When dealing with RNNs 
we often use the term "cell" instead of "layer". There is nothing stopping us from 
creating a model architecture with multiple RNN cells. Also, keep in mind that there 
are many ways of sending in inputs and getting out outputs from RNN cells. Here we 
only present what is relevant for the model setup in this thesis.}
\begin{align}
    \bm{h}_t &= \tanh{(\bm{\omega}_{hh}\bm{h}_{t-1} + \bm{\omega}_{xh}\bm{x}_t+\bm{b}_h)} \\
    \bm{y}_t &= \bm{\omega}_{hy}\bm{h}_t + \bm{b}_y \citationneeded (should probably cite IN5400)
\end{align}
Here the variables are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\bm{y}_t$: The output vector (remember that there can be several output time series) at time step $t$.
    \item $\bm{h}_t$: The hidden state vector at time step $t$.
    \item $\bm{x}_t$: The input vector at time step $t$.
    \item $\bm{\omega}_{hh}$: The weight vector used for the previous hidden state to affect the new.
    \item $\bm{\omega}_{xh}$: The weight vector that decides how much the input $\bm{x}_t$ affects the state of the RNN.
    \item $\bm{\omega}_{hy}$: The weight vector that decides how much the hidden state $h_t$ affects the output $y_t$.
    \item $\bm{b}_h$: A bias term that adds constant change to the hidden state.
    \item $\bm{b}_y$: A bias term used when calculating the next time step $y_t$.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}
    \caption{An RNN cell}
\end{figure}
The reason RNNs are referred to as neural networks is possibly because they, like 
feed forward neural networks have their parameters trained using backpropagation.
The backpropagation algorithm for an RNN is quite a bit different although the 
underlying concept is the same. We argue it is not necessary to include the algorithm 
in this thesis but if the reader is interested they should read this source \citationneeded.
The important takeaway from the backpropagation algorithm used for RNNs (called 
Backpropagation Through Time), is that it used extreme amounts of memory because 
it needs to store values for every time step to be able to get proper gradients 
for the model parameters. Because of this, it is common to instead use an algorithm 
called Trunctated Backpropagation Through Time, where one stops saving values after 
a pre-defined time sequence. This saves memory but makes the model unable to learn 
dependencies further in time than the cutoff. It also leads to the introduction of 
a new hyperparameter which we will refer to as the \textbf{sequence length}. \citationneeded.

\subsection{Long Short-Term Memory}
\label{LSTM Theory}
The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is the type of RNN we employ in all our 
experiments in this thesis work. In this section we therefore also spend some 
time arguing why the way an LSTM model works fits the Physics we wish to simulate 
and is not just chosen by random. 

The LSTM is a more advanced type of recurrent neural network that exists because 
of a major drawback with the ordinary RNN. An RNN as described in the previous section 
struggles to learn long-term dependencies as the Backpropagation Through Time 
algorithm starts to downplay the importance of previous time-steps the further one 
advances in time  \cite{bengio1994learning}. The LSTM model is designed to fix this, 
hence the name. This is the reason we use the LSTM model and not a normal RNN in 
this thesis even though an RNN would be less computationally expensive to train, 
many of the dependencies in traditional rainfall-runoff modelling are long term. 
The most obvious case is the modelling of snow. Not the melting itself, but for 
the model to remember that snow accumulation can lead to lower discharge when it 
happens and more discharge once the snow starts to melt.

The biggest mathematical difference between a normal RNN and an LSTM is the introduction 
of the cell state $\bm{c}_t$. Mathematically, the model is described like this:
\begin{align}
\cite{hochreiter1997long}
\end{align}

\subsection{Feature selection}
\subsubsection{Permutation test}
\label{Feature selection}
One of the criticisms of machine learning methods
is that they are not easily interpretable. This 
is especially true if one wants to train a model 
on a dataset with an overwhelming amount of 
features. There are several strategies for 
selecting a smaller subset of features in a dataset.
The method we briefly describe here is called the 
permutation test:
Given a feature $j$, the permutation importance 
$i_j$ is equal to 
\begin{equation}
i_j = s - \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K s_{k,j}\quad \cite{permutation}.
\label{Permutation equation}
\end{equation}
Here $K$ denotes how many permutations we average over for each feature, $s$ is
the model's score on the original data and $s_{k,j}$ is the score of permutation 
number $k$ of the feature $j$. In essence (\ref{Permutation equation}) describes 
how much the performance of a model varies when "destroying" the information 
contained in a feature, therefore explaining the importance of the feature 
according to the current model. It is then important to remember that this is not 
the true importance of the feature, only the importance the model thinks the feature 
has. The scoring method $s$ can be any model scoring statistic, often the $R^2$
score for regression.
A major problem for this method is that (\ref{Permutation equation}) could give 
unrealistically low significance to features that are highly correlated to other 
features. In this case the feature may very well be important, but the information 
contained in it is also contained in one or more other correlated features, meaning 
the model doesn't lose as much information as one may think.

A way around this is to first remove unneeded correlated features so that the model 
contains as little duplicate information as possible. Reducing the amount of 
features also has the added benefit of reducing the model variance because of 
decreased complexity and improving model interpretability as getting an intuitive 
understanding of what a model needs to properly approximate a system is easier when 
there are fewer features.

A method to remove correlated features that is fairly simple to use is hierarchical 
clustering on the correlation of the features in a dataset. 
The most well known algorithm for finding correlation is called Pearson correlation. It has 
the drawback of only finding linear correlation. Spearman correlation on the other 
hand is more general and can find non-linear correlation \cite{spearman}. After 
finding the correlations of the features one then uses a clustering method to 
visualize these correlations. The source at \cite{permutation_clustering} suggests 
using hierarchical clustering and choosing a single feature from each branch below 
a chosen threshold. For illustrational purposes we include such a clustering figure
created on synthetic data, it can be seen in figure \ref{wald example}.
While \cite{permutation_clustering} suggests using the Spearman rank order correlation,
we instead choose to use the Pearson correlation as it is more easily interpretable.
Also, when removing features we argue that it should not matter whether two variables 
are strongly positively or negatively correlated, so we choose to do hierarchical 
clustering based on the absolute value of the Pearson correlation.
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics{{examples}/cluster_example.pdf}
	\caption{Example of a hierarchical plot created on a simple Gaussian distributions.}
    \label{wald example}
\end{figure}
The idea here is to set a level at the y-axis of the plot, each branch that is
"cut off" will then only get to contribute one single feature, discarding all others.
For instance: In figure \ref{wald example} we may want to set the level at 0.1. 
This would lead to only 4 features being included, which would make sense as we 
for instance do not need $2x$, $x$ and $-x$ in the same model, those features 
represent the same information.

\subsection{Drawbacks}
