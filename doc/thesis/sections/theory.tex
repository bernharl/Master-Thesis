\section{Machine Learning}
We give a brief explanation of the basics in Machine Learning here for better context 
before elaborating on the LSTM model central to this thesis.
The term Machine Learning was coined in \citationneeded by .... 
Machine Learning is a type of frequentist approach to statistical analysis where 
one creates a statistical model, often with several million parameters and finds 
the value of each parameter that makes the model approximate the data in the most 
accurate manner. How to find these parameters and how they are used differ for each 
model type. 
\subsection{Linear regression}
In the simple case of the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model we have a model on the form 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\hat{y}} = \mathbf{\beta} \mathbf{X}
\label{OLS}
\end{equation}
This assumes that the outcome $\mathbf{\hat{y}}$ can we represented as a linear combination 
of some fitted parameters $\mathbf{\beta}$ and the input features $\mathbf{X}$.
The goal here is then to find the minimum of the mean squared error (MSE) of this.
The MSE is defined as 
\begin{equation}
MSE = |\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{\hat{y}}|^2
\label{MSE}
\end{equation}
Here $\mathbf{y}$ is the observed outcome, in many cases called the ground truth.
$\mathbf{\hat{y}}$ is the prediction made by (\ref{OLS}). The goal is to find the
$\mathbf{\beta}$ that minimizes (\ref{MSE}). For this there is an alalytical solution 
as long as the matrix in (\ref{OLS}) is reversible. In other words: This can be solved
analytically as long as there are more datapoints than there are variables (features, inputs).
The solution to the equation can be written as 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\beta} = (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{y}
\label{OLS solution}
\end{equation}
\subsection{Bias-Variance tradeoff}
When training any kind of machine learning model, one usually divides the data 
into at least two parts: The training dataset and the testing dataset. The training 
dataset is for training a given model, while the testing dataset is to be kept separate 
from the training process so as to not make the performance metrics of the model too optimistic. 
By "optimistic" what is meant is that the error, for scalar values (\ref{MSE}) is 
lower on the data the model is trained on than on data the model has not seen under 
training. The function that is minimized under machine learning is called a 
cost function and while (\ref{MSE}) is very commonly used for scalar outcomes 
there exist many other cost functions all with different characteristics. \citationneeded

To explain 
why this is important we need to have a quick look at what is known as the 
bias variance tradeoff.
In the case of the OLS model the MSE can be rewritten into three parts:
\begin{equation}
    MSE = \text{Bias}^2 + \text{Variance} + \sigma^2
    \label{Bias Variance Decomp}
\end{equation}
For a full derivation of this, see \cite{vijayakumar2007bias}. When selecting and 
configuring machine learning models this tradeoff is essential. The following is 
a qualitative explanation of what each term in (\ref{Bias Variance Decomp})
represents:
\begin{itemize}
\item Bias: The bias is the part of the error that comes from a model's lack of complexity.  If one were to try and represent a non-linear system on the form of (\ref{OLS}) for instance one would struggle to model the more complex interactions between input and outcome.
\item Variance: In many ways this error is the opposite of bias. It comes from a given model having too much complexity. This could come from the model having too many parameters to train compared to how much data is available for training. 
\item $\sigma^2$: This is known as the irreducible error. It is the inherent error in the data that is used for training. The model cannot reduce the error below this value as it is indepentent from the model. To reduce this error one would have to gather more accurate data using better instruments for instance. 
\end{itemize}
The aim of training a machine learning model is to find the best tradeoff between model
complexity and stability in search of the minimum of (\ref{Bias Variance Decomp}).
\subsection{Gradient Descent}
While the simple case of linear regression has an easily attainable analytical solution 
as seen in (\ref{OLS solution}), more advanced models may not. \citationneeded 
A generic computational optimization algorithm known as Gradient Descent can therefore 
be beneficial to employ in such a case \cite{elemstatlearn} \cite{handson}. The 
fundamental concept of Gradient Descent is to calculate the gradient $\Delta F(\mathbf{x})$ 
of the loss function $F(\mathbf{x})$. In the case of regression this function would 
be the MSE as described in (\ref{MSE}) while the variable $\mathbf{x}$ would be 
the regression coefficients $\mathbf{\beta}$. After calculating $\Delta F(\mathbf{x})$ 
one then does a gradient descent step, which is defined as
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{x}_{i+1} = \mathbf{x}_{i} - \lambda \Delta F(\mathbf{x_i}).
	\label{Gradient descent}
\end{equation}
Here the subscript $i$ denotes the epoch. An epoch is defined as the point when 
the optimization algorithm has seen all the data in your training set once. 
$\lambda$ is called the learning rate and is known as a hyperparameter. 
A hyperparameter is a model parameter that is not trained in the training process 
and has to be optimized in a different way. More on this in chapter \ref{Hyperparameters}
A problem with (\ref{Gradient descent}) is that one is never guaranteed to find the 
absolute minimum of $F(\mathbf{x})$, the algorithm often converges at local minima \cite{elemstatlearn}.
The solution to this is to introduce stochasticity to the optimization algorithm. 
Stochastic Gradient Descent is a modification of (\ref{Gradient descent}) which 
iterates over minibatches of your dataset instead of the entire dataset at once. 
This has two main benefits:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It adds stochasticity by shuffling the batches for each epoch.
\item It significantly reduces the amount of RAM needed to run the calculations on a computer.
\end{enumerate}
Introducing minibatches yields another hyperparameter in form of the batch size. 
This is the amount of datapoints to be used in each iterations. An iteration is 
defined as when the optimizer has seen all datapoints in a minibatch, and there are 
therefore several iterations in an epoch.
Adding more complexity to Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) we get to the optimizer 
known as Adaptive Moment EstimAtioN (Adam) \cite{adam}.

\subsection{Feature selection}
\subsubsection{Permutation test}
\label{Feature selection}
One of the critisisms of machine learning methods
is that they are not easily interpretable. This 
is especially true if one wants to train a model 
on a dataset with an overwhelming amount of 
features. There are several strategies for 
selecting a smaller subset of features in a dataset.
The method we briefly describe here is called the 
permutation test:
Given a feature $j$, the permutation importance 
$i_j$ is equal to 
\begin{equation}
i_j = s - \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K s_{k,j}\quad \cite{permutation}.
\label{Permutation equation}
\end{equation}
Here $K$ denotes how many permutations we average over for each feature, $s$ is
the model's score on the original data and $s_{k,j}$ is the score of permutation 
number $k$ of the feature $j$. In essence (\ref{Permutation equation}) describes 
how much the performance of a model varies when "destroying" the information 
contained in a feature, therefore explaining the importance of the feature 
according to the current model. It is then important to remember that this is not 
the true importance of the feature, only the importance the model thinks the feature 
has. The scoring method $s$ can be any model scoring statistic, often the $R^2$
score for regression.
A major problem for this method is that (\ref{Permutation equation}) could give 
unrealistically low significance to features that are highly correlated to other 
features. In this case the feature may very well be important, but the information 
contained in it is also contained in one or more other correlated features, meaning 
the model doesn't lose as much information as one may think.

A way around this is to first remove unneeded correlated features so that the model 
contains as little duplicate information as possible. Reducing the amount of 
features also has the added benefit of reducing the model variance because of 
decreased complexity and improving model interpretability as getting an intuitive 
understanding of what a model needs to properly approximate a system is easier when 
there are fewer features.

A method to remove correlated features that is fairly simple to use is hierarchial 
clustering on the correlation of the features in a dataset. 
The most well known algorithm for finding correlation is called Pearson correlation. It has 
the drawback of only finding linear correlation. Spearman correlation on the other 
hand is more general and can find non-linear correlation \cite{spearman}. After 
finding the correlations of the features one then uses a clustering method to 
visualize these correlations. The source at \cite{permutation_clustering} suggests 
using hirerarchial clustering and choosing a single feature from each branch below 
a chosen treshold. For illustational purposes we include such a clustering figure
created on synthetic data, it can be seen in figure \ref{wald example}.
While \cite{permutation_clustering} suggests using the Spearman rank order correlation,
we instead choose to use the Pearson correlation as it is more easily interpretable.
Also, when removing features we argue that it should not matter whether two variables 
are strongly positively or negativey correlated, so we choose to do hierarchial 
clustering based on the absolute value of the Pearson correlation.
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics{{examples}/cluster_example.pdf}
	\caption{Example of a hierarchical plot created on some simple gaussian distributions.}
    \label{wald example}
\end{figure}
The idea here is to set a level at the y-axis of the plot, each branch that is
"cut off" will then only get to contribute one single feature, discarding all others.
For instance: In figure \ref{wald example} we may want to set the level at 0.1. 
This would lead to only 4 features being included, which would make sense as we 
for instance do not need $2x$, $x$ and $-x$ in the same model, those features 
represent the same information.
