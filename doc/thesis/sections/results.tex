In this chapter we present our results in chronological order. Many of the results 
are found based on earlier results, so we find it natural to include some amount 
of discussion of the results as they are presented to be able to argue for why we 
approach the problem the way we do further down.

\section{Test performance of best models}
Note that when doing model selection we do not look at test set performance, only 
performance on the cross validated train set.

%    features as input values, and the NSE of an LSTM trained without static features
%    for each basin in the validation set. The $R^2$ score of this model is $\approx 0.5$}

%In table \ref{linreg_no_static_table} we can see that our linear regression used to model 
%the relationship between NSE value of models and static features has decided that 
%several features are important. All these coefficients have a p-value $<0.5$. The 
%problem with this model was that it achieved an $R^2$ score of $\approx 0.5$, meaning 
%it does not actually explain the relationship well. We therefore choose to change 
%strategy for feature selection.
