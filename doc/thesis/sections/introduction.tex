Rainfall-runoff modelling is a very important problem for scientists and 
companies in the field of hydrology.
Results found by \cite{lstm_first_paper} indicate that given a good dataset, recurrent neural networks in the form of Long Short-Term Memory cells (LSTMs) can give results equal in quality to more classical hydrological models.
