\begin{itemize}
\item Restructure code [...] \begin{itemize}
\item Config files [v]
\item Sane train, validation, test split [v]
\item Python package [v]
\item Fix normalization [v]
\item Validation after each epoch [v]
\item Cross validation? [v]
\item Generic dataset support []
\end{itemize}
\item Create analysis figures in Jupyter Notebook instead of separate scripts?
The scripts are messy anyway and I'm not sure how to structure them. Ask Simon [v]
\item Feature reduction [...]
\begin{itemize}
\item Create a train, validation, test split [v]
\item Train model on full data, test on validation set to get baseline performance [v] -Next up!
\item Reduce correlated features, train new model on same split and compare validation performance [v]
\item If this works well, run permutation test to see if more features can be removed. [v]
\item Train new model again, check that it still performs well on same validation test. []
\item Refit model on both train and validation, get test results.  []
\end{itemize}
\item Analyze performance of this model on test set. []
\item Compare with a traditional model? [...]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ask in meeting about traditional models. [...]
        \item Bring up topic of simple hybrid model? []
    \end{itemize}
\item Write thesis! []
    \begin{itemize}
        \item week 51: Wrote initial info on CAMELS and CAMELS-GB, went from 21 pages to 22
    \end{itemize}
