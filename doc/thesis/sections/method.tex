\section{Model configuration}
The models we apply in this thesis are all variants of the LSTM model, desbribed in \ref{LSTM Theory}.
\section{Strategies for including static features}
LSTM models being reccurrent neural networks usually only support timeseries as 
inputs. However, as mentioned in  chapter \ref{Data}
