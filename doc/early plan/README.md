# This plan is outdated
It has been almost entirely reworked. Applying machine learning to the Shyft
model was deemed out of scope, the focus has instead been on data driven modelling 
on the CAMELS GB dataset, trying to get a good grip on feature importance so that 
we know what features are needed in a Norwegian dataset in the future. A thesis 
later down the line could then create this Norwegian dataset, and try out hybrid
modelling using for instance the Shyft model.
